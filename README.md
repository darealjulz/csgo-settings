## Questions

1. Q: Where do I get the SteamID needed for pasting the files?
1. A: There are several web-applications which let you paste in the url of your steam-profile, returning the wanted ID.
      For example [Steam Id Finder](http://steamidfinder.com/).
      You actually need the so called `Steam 3 ID`, which you can get by clicking on "Looking for Steam 3 ID?" after you searched.
